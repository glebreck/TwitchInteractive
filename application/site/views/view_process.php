			<p>whether you are building a new website, an intranet, mobile app or putting together a full web strategy, &nbsp;there are so many variables to be identified as the project moves forward. over the years, it has helped to <strong>develop a process</strong> with which almost every web/digital project or campaign can be held to. &nbsp;this process is in use for several reasons: &nbsp;to ensure that the <strong>goals and objectives</strong> of the project are being met at all stages, to bring about <strong>a cohesive voice</strong> from all parties tasked with creating the project and to ensure that <strong>deadlines and budgets are met</strong>.</p>

			<h2>debrief</h2>
			<p>the beginning of any good web strategy must begin with a thorough “debrief” session. &nbsp;This session is meant to <strong>uncover the goals, expectations, aspirations</strong> and final deliverables of the project. &nbsp;this session can be a few hours or a full day and can be with as many members of your team as you feel is necessary. &nbsp;in this session, we will discuss in detail everything from goals and objectives, to content strategy to the style of design that will be used. &nbsp;this time <strong>sets the tone</strong> for everything to come.</p>

			<h2>design</h2>
			<p>
				once we have uncovered your goals and expectations for the site the creative process begins. &nbsp;this can incorporate everything from wireframes, a working site map, experimenting with navigation flow, tying up content, and finally bringing all this information together to create the user interface.

			<h2>develop</h2>

				developing the user experience is, in its simplest form, pulling together all of the variables that would have been answered in the 2 previous stages of the process.  &nbsp;in its not so simple form, it is building the <strong>architecture</strong>, modeling the <strong>data structures</strong>, creating good clean animation, installing the many different pieces that make up the <strong>customized functionality</strong> and much more. &nbsp;this stage is the technical part of the process and <strong>involves a good bit of planning</strong>. functionality, interaction and content population are all part of creating the end result.

			<h2>deploy</h2>
			<p>
				the excitement of going live with a new web presence is a <strong>memorable experience</strong>.  &nbsp;although the main work is done, the job of making that presence a <strong>valuable tool</strong> to you are just beginning. &nbsp;maintaining any digital piece is important so your content will be seen by your<strong> consumers and search engines</strong> alike. &nbsp;no matter what the platform, you must be committed to being consistent with making your content valuable to your users.
